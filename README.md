# Leaks - Sample / Fictional Dataset

This repository contains **synthetic** and **fictional** "leak" examples for testing, demonstrations, and tooling development.  
**Important:** The records in this repo are not real — they are intentionally fabricated and labelled `FICTITIOUS_DO_NOT_USE_*`. Do not use these values for any real accounts or security testing against third-party systems.

## Purpose
- Provide harmless sample data for UI mockups, parsers, import scripts, and automated tests.
- Help developers and researchers validate parsing, sanitization, and display logic without exposing real sensitive data.

## Files
- `leaks.csv` — small CSV of fictional domain / username / password rows.
- `README.md` — this file.

## License / Use
Use freely for non-malicious development and testing. Do not reuse any real credentials. If you adapt this dataset, keep the `FICTITIOUS` marker so that no entry is mistaken for a real secret.

## ASCII art — Africa
Below is a simple ASCII art representation of the African continent (stylized and minimal):

               .-''''-.
             .'  .--.  `.
            /   /    \   \
           /   /      \   \
          ;   ;  .--.  ;   ;
          |   | (    ) |   |
          ;   ;  `--'  ;   ;
           \   \      /   /
            \   `.__.'   /
             `.        .'
               `-.__.-'

(Art is intentionally simple — not to scale — for display in plain-text README.)
